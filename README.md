Managing expenses can be challenging. **Smart Expense Tracker** is a powerful yet simple web app that helps users efficiently track their spending through two modes:

‚úÖ **Web Interface** for direct expense input and visualization.

Using **Google Gemini API**, the system extracts structured financial data from natural language inputs like:

All expenses are stored in an **SQLite database** and visualized with **bar and pie charts** for clear insights.
